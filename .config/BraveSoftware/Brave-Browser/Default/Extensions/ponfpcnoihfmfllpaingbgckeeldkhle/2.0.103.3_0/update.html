  <h2>Bug fixes and improvements</h2>
  <p>Hello, this is a quick update to inform you about important changes. Don't worry I don't display this kind of message for each update...</p>
  <h4>What has been fixed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>YouTube's “Autoplay” automatically turned on if “<em>Disable autoplay</em>” was not checked in “Options > Video player > Autoplay”</li>
    <li>YouTube's “Theater mode” automatically reset if “<em>Automatically enable YouTube's “Theater mode”</em>” was not checked in “Options > Appearance”</li>
    <li>YouTube's “Dark theme” automatically reset to “Light theme” if it was not selected in “Options > Theme”</li>
    <li>Tooltip and volume/speed info bar visible when resizing the video player or toggling the full screen mode</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I will fix the other issues as soon as possible.</p>
  <h4>What's new</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The “Options” control is back... But you can remove it in “Options > Video player > Controls” if you don't need it</li>
    <li>You can make a right click on the “Video filters” control to toggle the visibility of the video filters panel</li>
    <li>The size of the expanded player is different if you choose to control the volume with the mouse wheel “only when the right mouse button is pressed” or not because in some circumstances it was not possible to scroll down</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As you have just seen, I have also added a new button to display the controls only when you hover over it with the mouse cursor, and hide them when you move the mouse cursor away from it or from the controls. You can also click it to keep controls visible, then click another time to hide them. This button has been added for people who don't have a large monitor, but if it's not your case and you want controls to always remain visible you can use the following code as custom script in “Options > Custom script”. You can either check the option to execute it automatically when YouTube is loaded in a tab, or execute it only when needed by adding the “Custom script” control and clicking it when you want.</p>
  <pre style="background-color:#f5f5f5;border:.1em solid #ccc;padding:1em"><code>document.documentElement.classList.toggle('efyt-controls-visible');</code></pre>
  <p><strong>In the coming weeks</strong> I will add an option to place controls within a <strong>toolbar</strong> fixed at the bottom of the window like in previous version of the extension.</p>
  <h4>Loop mode</h4>
  <p>I thought it was obvious but apparently not everybody knows how to use numerical fields so here is a tip. When you want to quickly adjust the loop range, all you have to do is to click a field to give it the focus and use the mouse wheel to adjust the number. You can also maintain the mouse button pressed on the tiny “▲” or “▼” buttons.</p>
  <h4>Donors, translators, and enthusiast users</h4>
  <p>Your support, contributions, and positive feedbacks are really appreciated, thank you very much! I wish I could reply to everyone but unfortunately it would take me hours per day during weeks so I hope you understand.<br><br><strong>Translators:</strong> I have not yet added all the translations that I have received because I had to upload this version to fix important bugs, but don't worry I will add them in the coming days, please be patient.</p>
  <h4>Haters</h4>
  <p>How intelligent you are is beyond me, so if you are not able to open the options page and take a minute to click checkboxes, either ask someone to do it for you or uninstall the extension and search for an alternative instead of posting irrespectful and/or defamatory comments.</p>
  <h4>Bonus</h4>
  <p>If you are using one of the built-in YouTube-DeepDark themes you can use the following code as custom theme in “Options > Theme > Custom theme” to style the scrollbar.</p>
  <pre style="background-color:#f5f5f5;border:.1em solid #ccc;padding:1em"><code>html {
  scrollbar-color: var(--main-color) rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
  scrollbar-width: thin;
}
html:not([hide-scrollbar]) ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: var(--main-color);
}
html:not([hide-scrollbar]) ::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 8px;
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: var(--main-color);
}</code></pre>
  <h4>That's it for now!</h4>
  <p>Happy watching!<br><br>-----<br>The Developer</p>
